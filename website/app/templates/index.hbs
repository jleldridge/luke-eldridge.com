  <h1>Hello!</h1>

  <p>I am Luke Eldridge, a software engineer based out of Portland, Oregon. I
    have used several different languages in my career so far, including
    javascript, C#, golang, objective-c, ruby, and others. I have worked
    professionally on web apps and desktop apps for both MacOS and Windows.</p>

  <p>I am currently focusing on working with ReactJS, EmberJS, NodeJS, Ruby, or
    Go based stacks, but I pride myself on being able to use whatever tool is
    necessary to get a job done.</p>
